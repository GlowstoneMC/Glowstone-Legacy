Glowstone
==========

Introduction
------------

Glowstone is an open-source implementation of the
[Minecraft](http://minecraft.net) server software written in Java, originally
forked from Graham Edgecombe's now-defunct
[Lightstone](https://github.com/grahamedgecombe/lightstone) project.

The official server software has some shortcomings such as the use of threaded,
synchronous I/O along with high CPU and RAM usage. Glowstone aims to be a
lightweight and high-performance alternative.

Glowstone's main aim as a project independent from Lightstone is to offer a
higher-performance server while maintaining compatability with the multitude
of plugins available for the popular [Bukkit](http://bukkit.org) server plugin
development interface. It does this through implementing Bukkit classes and
loading Bukkit plugins which interface with these classes.

Building
--------

Glowstone can be built with the
[Java Development Kit](http://oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads) and
[Gradle](http://gradle.org). Gradle is also used for dependency
management.

The command `gradle` will build Glowstone and will put the compiled JAR in 
`~/build/distributions`, and `gradle install` will copy it to your local Maven 
repository. Additionally, if you prefer not to install Gradle you can simply 
use the provided `gradlew` and `gradlew.bat` files in place of `gradle` for 
commands.

Running
-------

Running Glowstone is simple because all dependencies, including Bukkit, are
shaded into the output jar at compile time thanks to a nifty Gradle plugin.
Simply execute `java -jar glowstone-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar` along with whatever
memory-related options to Java you desire, and the server should start.

By default, configuration is stored in the `config/` subdirectory and logs
are stored in the `logs/` subdirectory. The main configuration file is
`config/glowstone.yml`, which replaces CraftBukkit's `server.properties` and
`bukkit.yml`. Settings from these two files will be copied over to Glowstone's
configuration during the default configuration generation process.

Glowstone uses a [JLine](http://jline.sf.net)-based server console for command
input. On non-Windows systems, console output can also be colored. 

Documentation
-------------

Javadocs can be generated by using the `gradle javadoc` command in the
terminal. To view the javadocs simply go to `~/build/docs/javadoc/` 
and open `index.html` in a web browser.

For documentation on the Bukkit API, see the
[Bukkit Javadocs](http://jd.bukkit.org/).
